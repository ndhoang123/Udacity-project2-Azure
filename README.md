# Udacity-project2-Azure
This is repo for project 2 of azure devops

[![Python application test with Github Actions](https://github.com/ndhoang123/Udacity-project2-Azure/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ndhoang123/Udacity-project2-Azure/actions/workflows/pythonapp.yml)
# Overview

The comprehensive guidelines is to guide you to build CI/CD by combining the Azure Devops and Github, Github Action.

## Project Plan
In order to work efficienly and be on time, we have to make a plan as well as the board to trace the status of our steps on the project:

- A [project plan](#) is for the plan of project

- A [board of our project](#https://trello.com/invite/b/KI1ZIwDl/ATTI59d916a4f9a454fa5095d56bc2431a576FE94015/udacity-project2-tracking) is used to see the status of tasks

## Instructions

<TODO:  
* Architectural Diagram (Shows how key parts of the system work)>

<TODO:  Instructions for running the Python project.  How could a user with no context run this project without asking you for any help.  Include screenshots with explicit steps to create that work. Be sure to at least include the following screenshots:

* Project running on Azure App Service

* Project cloned into Azure Cloud Shell

* Passing tests that are displayed after running the `make all` command from the `Makefile`

* Output of a test run

* Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines.  [Note the official documentation should be referred to and double checked as you setup CI/CD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/python-webapp?view=azure-devops).

* Running Azure App Service from Azure Pipelines automatic deployment

* Successful prediction from deployed flask app in Azure Cloud Shell.  [Use this file as a template for the deployed prediction](https://github.com/udacity/nd082-Azure-Cloud-DevOps-Starter-Code/blob/master/C2-AgileDevelopmentwithAzure/project/starter_files/flask-sklearn/make_predict_azure_app.sh).
The output should look similar to this:

```bash
udacity@Azure:~$ ./make_predict_azure_app.sh
Port: 443
{"prediction":[20.35373177134412]}
```

* Output of streamed log files from deployed application
```bash
marcdh97 [ ~/Udacity-project2-Azure ]$ ./make_predict_azure_app.sh
Port: 443
{"prediction":[48976299843.46421]}
```

## Enhancements
- Some features that we intend to improve in the upcoming days
    - Improve the UI
    - Add more features that the user want to add from both FE and BE
    - etc, ...
